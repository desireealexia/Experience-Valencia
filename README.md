## Design

### Colour Palette

The colour palette for the Experience Valencia website was selected to reflect the vibrant and dynamic essence of Valencia while ensuring readability and visual harmony. The palette is inspired by the colours of the [Valencian Community Flag](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTHDltCMJWOwD_TXM0lBRmdTQM0RO9Ol97DFQ&s) and has been strategically applied across various elements of the website.

<img src="/assets/design/ev_colour-palette.png" alt="Experience Valencia colour palette made in Coolors">

Below is a detailed description of each colour and its usage:

#### Background Colour - Off-white (#FAFAFA):

#### Text Colours - Black (#000) and White (#FFF):

- Black is used for primary text elements such as body text and heading. It ensures high contrast against the background, making content clear and easy to read.
- White is applied to text on darker backgrounds or as highlights to ensure visibility and contrast especially in sections with the primary and accent colours.

#### Primary Colour - Blue (#1C5B97)

For this website, typography plays a crucial role in enhancing readability and visual appeal. Google Fonts was utilised to ensure high-quality and consistent typography across all pages.

- **Headings:** The font used for heading is _League Spartan_, a bold sans-serif font. This font was chosen for its modern and clean appearance, making it ideal for headings. It provides a strong visual hierarchy and helps highlight important sections and headings on the website.
- **Body text:** The body text uses _Quicksand_, a sans-serif font selected for its readability and friendly, rounded design. This font ensures that the content is easy to read on all devices and provides a pleasant reading experience.

<img src="/assets/design/google_fonts.png" alt="Google Fonts used on the website">

### Imagery

#### Main Images

- **Hero Image:** Features an image of L'Umbracle Terraza, part of the City of Arts and Sciences, to immediately capture the visitor's attention and set the tone for the website.
- **Explore Valencia Page:** Includes images of key attractions such as the City of Arts and Sciences, The Silk Exchange, and popular local dishes. These images were selected to highlight the city's diverse cultural and culinary delights.

#### Icons

- **Home Page and Explore Valencia Page Icons:** Represent different selections and features providing a cohesive visual language across the site.

#### Logo and Favicon

The rectangles are coloured in the colours of the Valencian flag — blue, yellow, and red - used throughout the website. Beneath the rectangles, the text “Experience Valencia” is displayed in a clean, readable font. This logo is prominently featured across all pages to maintain brand identity.

<img src="/assets/images/experience_valencia_logo.webp" width="300" height="300" alt="Experience Valencia logo">

- **Favicon:** The favicon is a simplified version of the logo, omitting the text and featuring the three vertical rectangles with the icons. It appears in the browser tab to provide a consistent branding experience.

## Wireframes

I began the design process by sketching initial concepts on paper. This allowed me to explore various layouts quickly and refine the structure before moving to digital tools. Once I was satisfied with the paper sketches, I digitalised them using Figma to create more polished wireframes. These wireframes were essential in planning the layout and structure of each page and ensuring that the design was responsive across different device sizes.

Initially, I designed wireframes for three main pages: a Home page, an Explore Valencia page, and an Essential Tips page. The Essential Tips page was intended to provide essential information for users. However, as the project evolved, I decided to integrate the content from the Essential Tips page into the Home page, eliminating the need for a separate page dedicated to essential tips. This adjustment led me to change the layout of the Home page to accommodate this content and focus the third page on contact functionality, resulting in the creation of the Contact Us page.

### Essential Tips Page Wireframe (Not Implemented):

The original wireframe for this page included a section dedicated to visitor tips and advice. Although it was a useful idea, I ultimately decided to merge this content into the Home page for simplicity and better flow.

<img src="/assets/design/wireframes/wireframe_essential_tips.png" alt="Image of Essential Tips page wireframe (not implemented on the website)" width="500">

### Home Page Wireframe:

This Home Page was adjusted to include the essential tips directly on the page, providing users with an introduction to Valencia and essential tips in one place.

<img src="/assets/design/wireframes/wireframe_home.png" alt="Image of Home page wireframe" width="500">

### Explore Valencia Page Wireframe:

The Explore Valencia wireframe focused on showcasing popular attractions and local cuisine.

<img src="/assets/design/wireframes/wireframe_explore.png" alt="Image of Explore Valencia page wireframe" width="500">

These wireframes were created to ensure the design was responsive and looked good on different devices. I specifically designed them for three device sizes:

- Mobile: width 576px
- Tablet: width 768px
- Desktop: width 1200px

Since the Contact Us page has a straightforward design, I did not create a wireframe for it. The page was planned and implemented directly in the development phase, focusing on a simple and effective user interface to facilitate easy communication between users and Experience Valencia.

I also did not create wireframes for the 404 and Thank You pages as they were not part of my initial project plan. However, after receiving advice from my mentor, Diego, I recognised the importance of including these pages for a better user experience. Since this decision was made late in the project, I did not have wireframes prepared for these pages.

# Features

The website contains five pages: three main pages which can be accessed using the navigation menu, and two additional pages. The main pages are the Home page, Explore Valencia page and Contact Us page. The additional pages are a Thank You page which appears after form submission, and a 404 page which appears when a user requests a non-existent page.

# Accessibility

Ensuring accessibility is a fundamental aspect of creating an inclusive and user-friendly website. The Experience Valencia website was designed with accessibility in mind to accommodate users of all abilities and devices.

- **Semantic HTML:** Used semantic HTML elements, such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>` and `<footer>` to structure the content on the website. This improves the website's readability for screen readers and other assistive technology.
- **Clear and Consistent Headings and Labels:** Headings are used in hierarchical order - `<h1>` for main titles and `<h2>` for section headings - to create a logical flow of information. This helps users who rely on screen readers to navigate through content efficiently. Form fields and interactive elements include descriptive labels to ensure clarity and usability for all users.
- **`alt` Text for All Images:** All images on the website include descriptive `alt` attributes to provide context and information for users who rely on screen readers. This ensures that visual content is accessible to users with visual impairments.
- **Hover States and Visual Feedback:** Visual feedback, such as hover states on buttons and interactive elements is provided to indicate that elements are interactive.
- **`aria-label` on Links and Interactive Elements:** Added `aria-label` attributes to interactive elements where necessary to provide additional context for screen readers.
- **Keyboard Navigation:** All interactive elements are accessible via keyboard navigation. Users can tab through links, form fields and buttons, and use the Enter key to activate them.
- **Text Contrast:** Verified that text and background colour combinations meet accessibility standards using the Accessible Colour Palette Builder and WebAIM Contrast Checker. This ensures sufficient contrast ratios for readability, especially for users with low vision or colour blindness.

<img src="/assets/design/ev_colour-accessibility.png" alt="Accessible colour palette for text contrast">

- **Focus Indicators:** Applied clear focus indicators (such as colours) on interactive elements to help users who navigate via keyboard, this helps users know which element is currently focused.
- **Responsive Design:** Website is designed to be responsive and functional on various devices and screen sizes. This includes making sure that all interactive elements and content are accessible and usable on mobile devices, tablets and desktop computers.

## Performance Issues and Solutions

### Delayed Image Loading on the Explore Valencia Page

**Issue:** On the Explore Valencia page, the images in the attractions and cuisine sections experience a noticeable delay in loading. This affects the user experience as users may see placeholders or incomplete images before the final content is fully displayed.

#### Possible Causes:

- **Large Image Files**: High-resolution images can take longer to load if they are not optimised for the web.
- **Network Latency:** Slow network speeds or server response times can impact the speed at which images are fetched and displayed.
- **Missing Optimisation Techniques:** Lack of image optimisation or preloading can contribute to slower image loading times.

#### Solutions Implemented:

- **Image Compression:** Images have been compressed to reduce their file size without significantly affecting quality. This helps decrease load times and improve overall performance.
- **Lazy Loading:** Implemented lazy loading to defer the loading of images until they are needed. This is achieved by adding the `loading="lazy"` attribute to image tags, which improves page load times for users.

`<img src="" alt="Attraction Image" loading="lazy">`

- **Preloading Images:** Added `<link rel="preload">` tags to hint the browser to preload critical images, ensuring they are available immediately when needed.

`<link rel="preload" href="" as="image">`

- **WebP Format:** Considered using modern image formats like WebP to reduce file sizes and enhance load times compared to traditional formats like JPEG or PNG.

## Code Validation

### HTML Validator

To ensure the correctness of the HTML code, I used the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/). The validation process revealed no errors in the HTML code across all pages of the website. This confirms that the HTML is properly structured and adheres to web standards.

### CSS Validator

For CSS validation, I utilised the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). The CSS code was thoroughly checked, and no errors were found. This indicates that the CSS is correctly formatted and conforms to the established CSS standards.

## Bugs

### Background Image Not Appearing

**Issue:** The background image for the hero section was not appearing on any of the pages after converting all images to .webp formats. The problem was identified as being related to the file path used for the background image in the CSS. Despite multiple attempts to correct the path, the image did not display as expected.

**Resolution:** After researching similar issues online, I found a solution on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8783026/css-background-image-in-a-different-folder-from-css) here others had faced the same problem. It was determined that the file path needed to be placed in quotation marks. Implementing this solution resolved the issue, and the background image displayed correctly across all pages.

### Hero Section Text Not Centring

**Issue:** The hero section text would not centre and kept staying at the top of the `div`. After many attempts at centring the text, it was eventually centred but split into two columns. The problem was resolved with guidance from my mentor. The issue was related to CSS properties used for alignment and layout.

**Resolution:** The solution involved using Flexbox to center the text vertically and horizontally, and adjusting height properties. The following CSS was used:

```
.hero-bg {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  height: 60%;
  max-height: 500px;
```

### Images Not Fitting on Explore Valencia Page

**Issue:** Images of attractions and cuisine on the Explore Valencia page did not fit properly within their containers. The images were not scaling correctly to fit their containers.

**Resolution:** The solution was found on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14142378/how-can-i-fill-a-div-with-an-image-while-keeping-it-proportional) and involved using `object-fit: cover` to ensure the images covered the container without distortion.

### Contact Form Redirecting to Error Page

**Issue:** After creating the `thank-you.html` page and connecting it to the contact form using the `action` attribute, testing the form resulted in an error page. The form used the POST method, which was not suitable as there was no database connected to handle the request.

**Resolution:** The HTTP method was changed from POST to GET to resolve the issue.

## Lighthouse Testing

To ensure the best user experience, I conducted performance testing using Google Lighthouse. Below are the results and any actions taken based on the findings:

### Home Page

The Home page initially received a performance score of 73, primarily due to issues with the hero image. To address this, I compressed he hero image using TinyPNG and added `rel="preload"` in the HTML `<head>` to prioritise its loading, which improved the page's performance score.

![Home page lighthouse results](assets/screenshots/lighthouse/index.html_lighthouse.png)

### Explore Valencia Page

For the Explore Valencia page, I achieved a performance score of 87. To improve this score, I compressed images in the attractions and cuisine sections, which significantly enhanced the page's loading speed.

![Explore Valencia page lighthouse results](/assets/screenshots/lighthouse/explore.html_lighthouse.png)

### Contact Us Page

The Contact Us page had a performance score of 76, with the main diagnostic issue being large layout shifts caused by late network requests and web font loading. To address these issues I used `rel="preload"` in the HTML `<head>`. This improved the performance score to 97.
